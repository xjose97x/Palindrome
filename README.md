# Palindrome
Console Program I made to calculate if a number is palindrome.
```
F(x) = inverted x.
If x == inverted x, then it is palindrome.
else x = x + inverted x;
repeat.
```
## Example
F(14) = 41.
Is 14 equal to 41? no.
then 14+41 = 55;
F(55) = 55.
Is 55 = 55? yes. then it is Palindrome.
## Note
If an infinite loop is produced is due to the number provided being a [Lychrel Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number)
